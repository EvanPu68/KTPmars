\title{Function that calculates LOF (RSS) with GCV criterion of fitted model}
\usage{
LOF(form, data, control)
}
\arguments{
\item{form}{an object of class 'formula': Specifically, a linear regression
formula that has the response variable's name and indicates the predictors.
It is similar to the formula used in lm(), but must add -1 at the end to
avoid an extra intercept column.}

\item{data}{a data frame with response and predictor variables.}

\item{control}{an object of class 'mars.control': a list of Mmax, d, and trace,
see helper file mars.control() for more information.}
}
\value{
value of LOF (RSS) with GCV criterion of fitted model
}
\description{
Function that calculates LOF (RSS) with GCV criterion of fitted model
}
\examples{
tlof <- LOF(form = ConcreteCompressiveStrength~.-1,data = concrete,
control=mars.control())
